          <h3>Caernarfon Castle</h3>
          <p>
            Caernarfon castle is one of the most visited attractions in the whole of North Wales and one of the more interesting historical monuments 
            throughout the whole UK. The castle as it stands today began construction in 1283 by King Edward I and he was the first of many royals to 
            spend time at Caernarfon castle over its near 1000 year history and the castle today is a fascinating, storied structure to behold. Caernarfon 
            castle was the location of the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales in 1969, cementing the castle's continued importance to the Royal Family. 
            The castle today is maintained and administered by the Welsh historic environment service, Cadw, who keep it safe for visitors to freely 
            explore the outside and inside of the castle.
